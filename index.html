                    The first publication is about the Riemann's Hypothesis and the Riemann zeta function. <br>
                    I used some exercises and theorems to explain many properties of zeta functions and <br>
                    utilized modular form theory to generate Dirichlet series. Unfortunately, it has not been <br>
                    officially published yet, but it has been accepted by CONF-APMM 2024 and will soon <br>
                    be published in JPCS or TNS. <br>

                    The second publication dealt with the mathematical principles of cryptography. It mainly <br>
                    describes the development history of cryptography, some mathematicians study the theory <br>
                    of cryptography and discusses the relationship between cryptography and modern society. <br>
                    Because it is an internal publication of my college, it is written in Chinese.<br>
